## 👀 Motivation

For different projects I have been using go and [AlbertHernandez](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez) shared a template for nestjs, I decided to have an idea based on his project to provide a golang project using fiber as a web framework. . to start using it, this project is strictly based on [nestjs-service-template](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/nestjs-service-template)

## 🎖️ Credits

This project is based on the original implementation by [AlbertHernandez](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez), which was written in **Typescript**. We would like to thank AlbertHernandez for their inspiration.

## 🌟 What is including this template?

1. 🐳 Fully dockerized service ready for development and production environments with the best practices for docker, trying to provide a performance and small image just with the code we really need in your environments.
2. 🚀 CI/CD using GitHub Actions, helping ensure a good quality of our code and providing useful insights about dependencies, security vulnerabilities and others.
